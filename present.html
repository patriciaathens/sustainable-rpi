            <h4>Reduce & Reuse First, Then Recycle:</h4>
            <p class="grey">Though recycling does play an important role in reducing your carbon footprint, reducing and reusing the materials you use plays a much bigger role. Remember that recycling still produces extra waste, since energy and resources are required to transport and break down materials. Additionally, most people do not sort their recycling properly, recycled materials have a significant decrease in quality, and only a certain percentage of recycled materials after processing are able to be used again.
                <br><br>First start by reducing the amount of waste you use by not buying into wasteful products. Think about the packaging, production, and reusability of the product. Then, reuse what you can. Products like water bottles and canvas bags are easily accessible and simple to reuse. Finally, recycle what you donâ€™t use anymore. Make sure to follow the simple stream recycling guidelines on campus for normal items. For technology, be sure to use the tech dumps on campus.</p>
