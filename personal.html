            <h4>Reduce & Reuse First, Then Recycle</h4>
            <p class="grey">Though recycling does play an important role in reducing your carbon footprint, reducing and reusing the materials you use plays a much bigger role. Remember that recycling still produces extra waste, since energy and resources are required to transport and break down materials. Additionally, most people do not sort their recycling properly, recycled materials have a significant decrease in quality, and only a certain percentage of recycled materials after processing are able to be used again.
                <br><br>First start by reducing the amount of waste you use by not buying into wasteful products. Think about the packaging, production, and reusability of the product. Then, reuse what you can. Products like water bottles and canvas bags are easily accessible and simple to reuse. Finally, recycle what you don’t use anymore. Make sure to follow the simple stream recycling guidelines on campus for normal items. For technology, be sure to use the tech dumps on campus.</p>

                <h4>Watch Your Water Usage</h4>
                <p class="grey">Less than 1% of the world’s water is freshwater and available for consumption. Furthermore, freshwater is a crucial element in our survival, our agriculture, and the diversity/survival of multiple ecosystems. Unfortunately, our environment pushes us to have a wasteful relationship with water. Toggle and automatic triggered faucets make turning off water flow in small moments of un-use difficult, and encourage wasted use.
                    <br><br>Start by looking at the amount of water you use while brushing your teeth or cleaning your dishes. Also pay attention to the temperature you use. Hot water takes a lot of energy to heat up, and heat-based appliances are the top consumers of energy. Some tips are to use a mug when brushing to limit wasted water, use cold water when you can on laundry day (and make sure to fill that dryer machine!), and to keep the water on a lower flow when washing dishes. In general, it’s best to practice a more active mindset and mindfulness about your water usage. Reducing our water waste starts with individual changes that grow into a larger cultural change in water usage and waste.</p>

            <h4>Drive Less, Walk More</h4>
            <p class="grey">A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Zooming out a bit, transportation greenhouse gases make up about 29% of all U.S. greenhouse gases (as of 2017). They are one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gases in the U.S. Transportation vehicles produce a lot of short term waste in their production, as well as long term waste with their emissions. There are also major human health concerns with some car emissions since car tailpipes lie close to our breathing level, making immediate air pollution due to transportation vehicles a huge concern in more crowded cities.
                <br><br>For those travelling to campus from further dorms, make an effort to bike, take the campus shuttle, or carpool with a friend. If you don’t have a bike, CDPHP bicycles (the green ones) are free for RPI students to use once you sign up on their website (just scroll down to CDPHP Cycle! Access and click Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute when registering). If you are planning to visit downtown Troy, or go further out, check out the CDTA shuttle schedules, as using this service is free for RPI students when you use your student ID card.</p>

            <h4>Start a Wellness Group</h4>
            <p class="grey">Like any big change, becoming more sustainable can require huge mindset and lifestyle changes, so grab some friends who are also interested to join you! It’s much easier to talk about difficulties and ideas with people who are closer to you, and with whom you share a mutual respect. If you have these kind of people to motivate you, it will be much easier to make bigger changes such as activities that might require some outreach and attending large community events. It can also be important in expanding your perspectives and broadening your understandings. If you can’t find a wellness group, try mapping out groups of people you can reach out to for motivation, support, and other aspects of your life.
                <br><br>Remember that large cultural changes start with smaller changes in individual mindsets. It’s important to properly understand your own views and mindsets before you start expanding your influence.</p>
