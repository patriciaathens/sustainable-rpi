                    <h5 class="dark">April 22, 2019</h5>
                    <p>Started in early April, student navabm posted a petition on RPI’s petition website demanding several changes that would help RPI’s climate change initiative. The student writes: “We demand the appointment of a qualified, full-time staff member to act as a Sustainability Director,” explaining that the lack of a designated coordinator deters the completion of student projects, which is especially true concerning larger-scale projects. The student also says “We demand that the administration draft and implement a Climate Action Plan, which will detail how the school plans to achieve zero net equivalent carbon emissions by 2030,” and points out that the current development plan (Rensselaer Plan 2024) only briefly mentions sustainability goals, and that no specific and measurable plans have been announced.
                        <br>On the 22nd of April, the petition reached its goal of 250 signatures, but since has not been reviewed by RPI Student Government or anyone else.</p>

                    <p>Ecologic, RPI’s oldest student environment club, disbands due to lack of membership. There is no indication of it ever reviving, and it is most likely that the trend will start affecting other sustainability clubs unless interest is renewed.</p>

                    <p>The Union Green Roof is the class gift for the graduating class of 2010. The roof presides over the top of the student union bookstore and is filled with succulent plants, planted by the students with the help of some department staff. The idea was implemented with additional help from the SSTF and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) clubs here at RPI.</p>

                    <h5 class="dark">2009 - Never Fully implemented</h5>
                    <p>In the 2009 Sustainability Charrette, plans for a wind turbine to be set up behind ECAV were made. The pieces for the turbine were brought together at the designated location, but the turbine itself never went up. Near the middle of 2015, Tom Rice, a student from the Center for Flow Physics & Control (CEFPAC) put up the turbine in order to gather data on reducing blade vibration. The turbine went back down afterwards, and has never been up since.</p>

                    <p>Initiated and endorsed by President Jackson, the Sustainability Charrette was a way to get students and staff together in order to create new solutions for increasing sustainability efforts on campus. Project ideas included repurposing of the ‘86 field, redesign of the approach, a wind turbine, and compositing initiatives. There is not a lot of information about the follow-up of the charrette, or about projects that actually fell through.</p>

                    <p>The Terra Café was first started as a student initiative project by members of Ecologic, but then turned into a Project Design & Innovation (PDI) project in business planning. It opens once a week, bringing locally sourced and organic food to students at RPI. Terra Café is run by RPI students and is considered one of the most notable and successful sustainability efforts on campus.</p>

                    <p>Directed by Oliver Holmes (a previous RPI professor on sustainable building design) and started in 1992, the Energy Program aimed to reduce energy costs by targeting small changes in building infrastructure and usage. The Program involved motivating building managers by directly showing them their energy bills and allowing them to reinvest money saved by greener changes. Through this program, RPI has saved numerous amounts of money on electricity alone, and continues to do so.</p>
